--- abstract

This document describes Mastic, a two-party VDAF for the following secure
aggregation task: each client holds an input and an associated weight, and the
data collector wants to aggregate the weights of all clients whose inputs begin
with a prefix chosen by the data collector. This functionality enables two
classes of applications. First, it allows grouping metrics by client attributes
without revealing which clients have which attributes. Second, it solves the
weighted heavy hitters problem, where the goal is to compute the subset of
inputs that have the highest total weight.

# Introduction

(RFC EDITOR: Remove this paragraph.) The source for this draft and the
reference code can be found at
https://github.com/jimouris/draft-mouris-cfrg-mastic.

The private "heavy hitters" problem is to compute the most popular input
strings generated by clients without learning the inputs themselves. For
example, a browser vendor might want to know which websites are visited most
frequently without learning which clients visited which websites.

This problem can be solved by combining a binary search with a subroutine
solving the private "prefix histogram" subproblem. The goal of this subproblem
is to count how many of the input strings begin with each of a sequence of
candidate prefixes. This subproblem can be solved using a Verifiable
Distributed Aggregation Function, or VDAF
{{!VDAF=I-D.draft-irtf-cfrg-vdaf-11}}. (TODO Update the VDAF reference to draft
12.) In particular, the Poplar1 VDAF described in {{Section 8 of !VDAF}}
describes how to distribute this computation amongst two aggregation servers
such that, as long as one server is honest, no individual's input is observed
in the clear. At the same time, Poplar1 allows the servers to detect and remove
any invalid measurements that would otherwise corrupt the computation.

This document describes Mastic {{MPDST24}}, a VDAF for the following, more
general functionality: each client holds an input and an associated weight, and
the data collector's goal is, for each candidate prefix, to aggregate the
weights of all clients whose inputs have the prefix in common. This
functionality gives rise to two types of applications:

1. "weighted heavy hitters": Rather than compute the most frequent inputs, as
   in plain heavy hitters, the goal here is to compute the set of inputs with
   the highest total weight. For example, a browser vendor might want to know
   which web pages have the highest average load time, perhaps indicating a
   performance issue in the browser. Because weighted heavy hitters is more
   general, Mastic can be used as a drop-in replacement for Poplar1. It is is
   also more efficient, requiring just one round of communication for
   preparation ({{Section 5.2 of !VDAF}}) compared to Poplar1's two rounds.

1. "attribute-based metrics": The Prio3 VDAF ({{Section 7 of !VDAF}}) can be
   used for a variety of aggregation tasks, ranging from simple summary
   statistics, like average or standard deviation, to more sophisticated
   summaries of data, like histograms or linear regression. In many situations,
   it is desirable to group such metrics by client attributes such as
   geolocation or user agent ({{Section 10.1.5 of ?RFC9110}}). Mastic provides
   this functionality without revealing any client's attribute to the
   aggregation servers or data collector.

The main component of Mastic is the Verifiable Incremental Distributed Point
Function (VIDPF) of {{MST24}}. VIDPF extends IDPF ({{Section 8.3 of !VDAF}}),
the main building block of Poplar1. Both IDPF and VIDPF are a form of function
secret sharing {{BGI15}}, where a client generates shares of a secret function
`F` such that each server can computes shares of `F(x)` for a chosen `x`. In
our case, the function being shared is associated with a secret input string
`alpha` and weight `beta` for which `F(x) = beta` for every prefix `x` of
`alpha` and `F(p) = 0` for every `x` this is not a prefix of `alpha`. The
scheme is verifiable in the sense that, for any two candidate prefixes of the
same length, the servers can verify that at most one of them evaluates to
`beta` and the other(s) evaluate(s) to `0`.

Mastic combines VIDPF with a method for checking that `beta` itself is a valid
weight. For example, if the weights represent page load times in seconds it is
important to make sure each weight is within a sensible range, say within
thirty seconds. Otherwise, misbehaving clients would be able to poison the
computation by reporting out of range values. This range check is accomplished
with the Fully Linear Proof (FLP) system of {{Section 7.3 of !VDAF}}. An FLP
allows properties of secret shared data to be validated without revealing the
data itself. In Mastic, the client generates an FLP of its `beta`'s validity;
when the servers are ready to evaluate the VIDPF, they first compute shares of
`beta` and verify the FLP. Then the VIDPF ensures that the non-`0` output of
the point function is the same for erach evaluation.

This document specifies VIDPF in {{vidpf}} and the composition of VIDPF and FLP
into Mastic in {{vidpf}}. The appendix includes supplementary material, including:

* {{motivation}} discusses some use cases that motivated Mastic's functionality; and
* {{additional-modes}} describes extensions and optimizations for Mastic at a high level.

# Conventions and Definitions {#conventions}

{::boilerplate bcp14-tagged}

This document uses the same conventions and definitions of {{Section 2 of
!VDAF}}. The following functions are as defined therein:

* `gen_rand(len: int) -> bytes`
* TODO List all functions we use in alphabetical order.

This document uses the following terms as defined in {{!VDAF}}:
"Aggregator",
"Client",
"Collector",
"aggregate result",
"aggregate share",
"aggregation parameter",
"batch",
"input share",
"measurement",
"output share",
"prep message",
"prep share", and
"report".

Mastic uses finite fields as specified in {{Section 6.1 of !VDAF}}. We usually
denote a generic finite field by `F` and its Python class object, a subclass of
`Field`, as `field: type[F]`.

An instance of Mastic is determined by a desired bit-length of the input,
denoted `BITS`, and an instance of the FLP in {{Section 7.3 of !VDAF}}. We
denote the class object for the FLP by `flp`.

The Client's measurement has two components: the input string `alpha: int` in
`range(2**BITS)` (TODO: The type may change once we solve issue \#34) and its
weight. The weight's type is denoted `Measurement` and is determined by the
FLP. (see {{Section 7.1 of !VDAF}}). We use `beta: list[F]` to denote the
encoded weight, obtained by invoking the FLP's measurement encoding method.

The aggregate result has type `list[AggResult]`, where `AggResult` is likewise
a type defined by the FLP. Each element of this list corresponds to the total
weight for one of the candidate prefixes.

Finally, Mastic usex eXtendable Output Functions (XOFs) as specified in
{{Section 6.2 of !VDAF}}.

{: #vidpf-params title="VIDPF parameters."}

This section specifies the Verifiable Incremental Distributed Point Function
(VIDPF) of {{MST24}}. Its parameters are summarized in {{vidpf-params}}.

VIDPF is a function secret sharing scheme {{BGI15}} for functions `F` for which:

  * `F(x) = [field(1)] + beta` if `x` is a prefix of `alpha`
  * `F(x) = field.zeros(VALUE_LEN+1)` if `x` is not a prefix of `alpha`

where `alpha` and `beta` are the input and encoded weight of a Client. The
scheme is designed to allow each Aggregator to compute a share of output `F(x)`
for any candidate prefix `x` without revealing any information about `alpha` or
`beta`. Furthermore, the output shares can be aggregated locally, allowing
each Aggregator to compute a share of the total weight for `x`.

Along with encoded weight `beta`, the output includes a counter prefix, denoted
`field(1)`, so that the total weight also includes the number of inputs that
begin with the given prefix. This allows for the Collector to take this into
account when decoding the aggregate result for each prefix. This is required by
{{Section 7.1 of !VDAF}}.

The Aggregators evaluate a Client's VIDPF on a sequence of candidate prefixes.
Imagine arranging these prefixes in a binary tree where each path from the root
corresponds to a prefix `x` and each node corresponds to a payload `F(x)`. We
refer to this as the "prefix tree".

When the Aggregators evaluate a Client's VIDPF, they verify three properites of
the prefix tree:

1. One-hotness: at every level of the tree, at most one node has a non-zero
   payload.

1. Path consistency: each payload is equal to the sum of the payloads of its
   children. If one-hotness holds, then this ensures the payload is equal to
   `[field(1)] + beta` for each node along the `alpha` path.

1. Counter consistency: the counter of the non-zero payload is equal to
   `field(1)`.

VIDPF is comprised of two algorithms.

The key generation algorithm, defined in {{vidpf-key-gen}} takes in a `(alpha,
beta)` and outputs secret shares of `F`. The shares take the form of a pair of
"keys", one for each Aggregator, and a sequence of "correction words" sent to
both Aggregators. We define correction words in the next section.

The key evaluation algorithm, defined in {{vidpf-key-eval}}, takes in the
correction words, the Aggregator's key, the sequence of candidate prefixes,
and the nonce associated with the Client's report. It outputs secret shares of
`beta`, the share of the payload for each prefix, and a byte string known as
the "evaluation proof". To verify one-hotness, payload consistency, and
counter consistency, the Aggregators check that the proofs they computed are
equal.

## Key Generation {#vidpf-key-gen}

The VIDPF-key generation algorithm run by each Client is listed below. The
specification invokes auxiliary functions defined in {{vidpf-aux}}. Its inputs
are the input string `alpha`, the encoded weight `beta`, a public nonce of
length `NONCE_SIZE`, and the randomness consumed by the algorithm of length
`RAND_SIZE`. Its outputs are the public sequence of "correction words", one for
each level of the tree, and the secret keys, one for each Aggregator.

> seed/control-bit invariant for each level. Define `CorrectionWord` and
> explain the role of correction words and define node proofs, which are unique
> to VIDPF.
>
> TODO Specify bounds on the inputs, namely that the nonce has to be random.
> (This is inherited from IDPF security considerations.)

# Definition of `Mastic` {#vdaf}

> there are some details to work out and security analysis to do. In the
> meantime, check out the current reference implementation at
> https://github.com/jimouris/draft-mouris-cfrg-mastic/tree/main/poc.

This section describes Mastic, a VDAF suitable for a plethora of aggregation
functions including sum, mean, histograms, heavy hitters, weighted
heavy-hitters (see {{weighted-heavy-hitters}}), attribute-based metrics (see
{{attribute-based-metrics}}), linear regression and more. Mastic allows
computing functions *à la* Prio3 VDAF {{Section 7 of !VDAF}}.

The core component of Mastic is a VIDPF as defined in {{vidpf}}. VIDPFs
inherently have the "one-hot verifiability" property, meaning that in each
level of the tree there exists at most one non-zero value. To guarantee that
the Client's input is well-formed, Mastic first verifies that the Client
measurement is valid at the root level using an FLP, and then, it ensures
that this valid measurement is propagated correctly down the tree using the
one-hot verifiability and the path verifiability properties. Note that Mastic
allows the measurement to be of any type that can be verified by an arithmetic
circuit, not just a counter. For instance, the measurement can be a tuple of
values, a string, a secret number within a public range, etc.

As described in {{conventions}}, each Client input consists of two components,
which we denote `alpha` and `beta`. At a high level, the Client generates VIDPF
keys that encodes `alpha` and `beta` and an FLP for the validity of `beta`.
Then the Client sends one VIDPF key to each Aggregator and also publishes the
VIDPF public share.
FLPs for certain validity functions, including most range proofs, rely on the
establishment of shared random coins (`joint randomness`) between the Client and
all Aggregators.
When it is necessary for the Client to generate joint randomness, it includes
generator seeds in its shares for each Aggregator, and the Aggregators confirm
that they have derived the same joint randomness during the FLP verification process.

 The Aggregators agree on an initial set of `level`-bit strings, where `level <
 BITS`. We refer to these strings as "candidate prefixes". They evaluate their
 VIDPF key shares at each prefix in this set, to obtain an additive share of
 the VIDPF output.

Mastic uses a combination of techniques to certify the validity of this output.

1. First, the Aggregators exchange VIDPF proofs. If they are equal, then
   this implies One-hot Verifiability and Path Verifiability as described in
   {{vidpf}}. One-hotness ensures that the VIDPF output contains `beta` at
   most once (and every other output is `0`). Path Verifiability implies
   that, if the previous level contained a non-zero value, then it is the
   same value as the current level.

2. Second, the Aggregators interactively verify the FLP ({{Section 7.1 of
   !VDAF}}) to assert that `beta` is valid. We instantiate the FLP with
   `FlpGeneric` from {{Section 7.3 of !VDAF}}, which defines validity via an
   arithmetic circuit ({{Section 7.3.2 of !VDAF}}) evaluated over (shares of)
   `beta`: if the output of the circuit is `0`, then the value is said to be
   "valid"; otherwise it is "invalid".

   If none of the candidate prefixes are a prefix of `alpha`, then the VIDPF
   output shares will not contain any shares of `beta`. Moreover, VIDPF
   as specified in {{vidpf-construction}} does not as specified permit
   evaluation at the root of the VIDPF tree. Instead, each Aggregator
   computes a share of `beta` by evaluating the VIDPF tree at prefixes `0`
   and `1` and `level == 0` and adding them up. One-hot Verifiability and
   Path Verifiability imply that the sum is equal to the Aggregator's share
   of `beta`.

   > CP: An alternative way to spell this is to say that VIDPF evaluation
   > outputs a share of `beta`, which is what our current API does in the
   > reference code.

The aggregate result is obtained by summing up the encoded measurement shares
for each prefix and computing some function of the sum. The aggregation
parameter contains the level and the set of candidate prefixes.

The Aggregators send their aggregate shares to the Collector, who unshards them
to recover the results for each candidate prefix.

# Definition of `Vidpf` {#vidpf-construction}

The construction of {{MST24}} builds on techniques from {{CP22}} to lift an IDPF
to a VIDPF with the properties described in {{vidpf}}. Instead of a 2-round
"secure sketch" MPC like that of Poplar1, the scheme relies on hashing.

# Motivating Applications {#motivation}
{:numbered="false"}

The design of Mastic is informed primarily by two use cases, which we describe here.

## Network Error Logging {#NEL}
{:numbered="false"}

Network Error Logging (NEL) is a mechanism used by web browsers to report errors
that occur while attempting to establish a connection to a server {{W3C23}}. Some
of these errors are visible to the server, but not all: failures in DNS, TCP,
TLS, and HTTP can occur without the server having any visibility into the issue.
A small amount of connection errors is expected, even under normal operating
conditions; but a sudden, substantial increase in errors may be an indication of
an outage, or a configuration issue impacting millions of users. Without a
reporting mechanism like NEL, these events would only manifest in the server's
telemetry as a drop in overall traffic.

NEL is particularly important for content delivery networks that handle HTTP
traffic for a large number of websites (typically millions). A content delivery
network acts as a reverse proxy between clients and origin servers that provides
a layer of caching and security services, such as DDoS protection.

Reports are comprised of the URL the client attempted to navigate to (e.g.,
"https://example.com"), the type of error that occurred, and metadata related to
the attempt, such as the time that elapsed between when the connection attempt
began and the error was observed (e.g., Section 7 of {{W3C23}}). Clients may
also report successful connection attempts to give the server a sense of the
error rate. The exact client behavior is determined by the reporting policy
specified by the server (see Section 5.1 of {{W3C23}}).

NEL data is privacy-sensitive for two reasons. First, it exposes information
that the server would not otherwise have access to, which can be abused to probe
the client's network configuration as described in Section 9 of {{W3C23}}.
Second, for operational reasons, the reporting endpoint may be organizationally
separated from the server (i.e., run on different cloud infrastructures),
leading to an increased risk of the client's browsing history being exposed
(e.g., in a data breach).

MPC helps mitigate these risks by revealing to the endpoint only the information
it needs to fulfill its service level objectives. This means, of course, we must
be satisfied with limited functionality. Fortunately, Mastic allows us to
preserve the most important functionality of NEL while minimizing privacy loss.

Mastic can be applied to a simplified version of NEL where each client reports
a tuple `(dom, err)` consisting of a domain name dom (e.g., "example.com") and
a value err that represents an error (e.g., "dns.unreachable") or an indication
that no error occurred (e.g., "ok"). Notably, this can be easily extended in
Mastic to represent more elaborate metrics. e.g., where each weight includes
the time it took each browser to report the error (and the aggregate is the
average error reporting time), user agent (browser type and version), etc.
However, our main goal is to understand 1) the distribution of errors and 2)
which domains are impacted.

We expect there to be a large number of distinct domain names (millions in the
case of content delivery networks) and only a small number of error variants
(the NEL spec {{W3C23}} defines 30 variants). The following Mastic parameters
are suitable for this application.

Each input would encode the domain `dom` encoded with a number of bits
sufficient to uniquely represent most of the domains; and each weight would
represent the error variant `dom`. To compute the distribution of errors, we
would encode each error variant as a distinct bucket of a histogram so that
`[1, 0, 0, ...]` represents "ok", `[0, 1, 0, ...]` represents
"dns.unreachable", and so on. (See ection 6 of {{W3C23}}.), This is similar to
Prio3Histogram ({{Section 7 of !VDAF}}.)

## Attribute-Based Browser Telemetry {#attribute-based-telemetry}
{:numbered="false"}

Web browsers collect telemetry generated by users as they navigate the web to
gain insights into trends that guide product decisions. In many cases, Prio3
({{Section 7 of !VDAF}}) can be used to privately aggregate this telemetry.
However, this comes at the cost of flexibility.

For example, Prio3 can be used to collect page load metrics from Browser for a
list of known popular sites (e.g., "example.com"). The purpose of these metrics
is to detect if changes to these sites cause regressions that might be
correlated with an increased average load time or error rate. A subtle, but
important requirement for this system is the ability to break down the metrics
by client attributes. Suppose for example that we want to aggregate by 1) the
software version, and 2) the information about the client's location.

Mastic provides a simple solution to this problem. For the sake of presentation,
we consider a simplified use case (the same approach can be applied to any
aggregation task for which Prio3 ({{Section 7 of !VDAF}}) is suitable). Each
client reports a tuple `(ver, loc, site, time)` where: `ver` is a string
representing the client's software version (e.g., "Browser/122.0"); `loc` is a
string encoding its country code (e.g., "GR", "US", "IN", etc.); `site` is one
of a fixed set of sites (e.g., "example.com", "example.org", etc.); and `time`
is the load time of the site in seconds. The version and location are included
in the Mastic input; the site and load time are encoded by the corresponding
weight. Notably, this is just one example of what Mastic can do; the same idea
can be applied to other types of metrics.

Compared to the private NEL application in {{NEL}}, the number of possible
inputs here is relatively small: there are less than 200 country codes and a
handful of browser versions in wide use at any given time. This means the
aggregators can enumerate a set of inputs of interest and evaluate them
immediately. Consider the following parameters for Mastic, in its
attribute-based metrics mode of operation {{attribute-based-metrics}}:

* Attributes: Two-letter country codes can easily be encoded in 2 bytes.
  Likewise, the number of distinct browser versions is easily less than 216, so
  2 bytes are sufficient. Therefore, each attribute can be encoded with just
  `32` bits.

* Values: Similar to private NEL, each weight is a `0`-vector except for a
  single `1` representing a bucket in a histogram. We represent `(site, time)`
  as a histogram bucket as follows. First, we quantize time (in seconds) into
  one of four buckets: `[0, 0.1)`, `[0.1, 1)`, `[1, 5)`, and `[5, inf)`. Let `0
  < t <= 4` denote the time bucket for `time`. Next, suppose we wish to track
  metrics for `25` sites. Let `0 < s <= 25` denote the index of `site` in this
  list. Then the index of 1 is simply `t * s`.

# Modes of Operation {#additional-modes}
{:numbered="false"}

## Weighted Heavy-Hitters {#weighted-heavy-hitters}
{:numbered="false"}

> See {{NEL}} for a motivating application and
> `example_weighted_heavy_hitters_mode()` in the reference implementation for an
> end-to-end example.

The primary use case for Mastic is a variant of the heavy-hitters problem, in
which the prefix counts are replaced with a notion of weight that is specific to
some application. For example, when measuring the performance of an ad campaign,
it is useful to learn not only which ads led to purchases, but how much money
was spent.

To support this use case, we view the Client's `alpha` value as its measurement
and the `beta` value as the measurement's "weight". The range of valid values
for `beta` are therefore determined by the FLP with which Mastic is
instantiated. Concretely, validity of `beta` is expressed by a validity circuit
({{Section 7.3.2 of !VDAF}}).

To compute the weighted heavy-hitters, the Collector and Aggregators proceed as
described in {{Section 8 of !VDAF}}, except that the threshold represents a
minimum weight rather than a minimum count. In addition:

1. The Aggregators MUST perform the range check (i.e., verify the FLP) at the
   first round of aggregation and remove any invalid reports before proceeding.

1. The level at which the reports are Aggregated MUST be strictly increasing.

### Different Thresholds {#different-thresholds}
{:numbered="false"}

> For an end-to-end example, see
> `example_weighted_heavy_hitters_mode_with_different_thresholds()` in the
> reference implementation.

So far, we have assumed that there is a single threshold for determining which
prefixes are "heavy". However, we can easily extend this to have different
thresholds for different prefixes. There exist use-cases where prefixes starting
with "000" may be significantly more popular than prefixes starting with "111".
Setting a low threshold may result in an overwhelmingly big set of heavy hitters
starting with "000", while setting a high threshold might prune anything
starting with "111". Consider the following examples:

1. Popular URLs: `a.example.com` receives a massive amount of traffic whereas
   `b.example.com` may have lower traffic. To identify heavy-hitting search
   queries on `a.example.com`, the Aggregators should set a high threshold,
   while queries with different domain prefixes may require lower thresholds to
   be considered popular.

2. E-commerce: Grocery items are essential and have a high volume of sales. In
   contrast, electronics, though popular, usually come with a higher price
   compared to groceries. Meanwhile, luxury items command significantly higher
   prices but generally experience lower sales volumes. To identify
   heavy-hitting grocery items on an e-commerce website, Aggregators could use
   different threshold for each of these categories. These thresholds are set to
   ensure that only the top-selling grocery items qualify as heavy hitters while
   electronics and luxury items are also considered heavy hitters on their own
   categories.

To tackle this, Mastic can allow different prefixes having different thresholds.
When a specific prefix does not have an associated threshold, we first search if
any of its prefixes has a specified threshold, otherwise we use a default
threshold. For example, if the Aggregators have set the thresholds to be
`{"000": 10, "111": 2, "default": 5}` and the search for prefix "01", then
threshold 5 should be used. However, if the Aggregators search for prefix
"11101", then threshold 2 should be used.

## Attribute-based Metrics {#attribute-based-metrics}
{:numbered="false"}

> See {{attribute-based-telemetry}} for a motivating application and
> `example_attribute_based_metrics_mode()` in the reference implementation for
> an end-to-end example.

In this mode of operation, we take the `beta` value to be the Client's
measurement and `alpha` to be an arbitrary "attribute". For a given sequence of
attributes, the goal of the Collector is to aggregate the measurements that
share the same attribute. This provides functionality similar to Prio3
{{!VDAF}}, except that the aggregate is partitioned by Clients who share some
property. For example, the attribute might encode the Client's user agent
{{?RFC9110}}.

Mastic requires each `alpha` to have the same length (`Vidpf.BITS`). Thus, it
is necessary for each application to choose a scheme for encoding attributes as
fixed-length strings. The following scheme is RECOMMENDED. Choose a
cryptographically secure hash function, such as SHA256
{{?SHS=DOI.10.6028/NIST.FIPS.180-4}}, compute the hash of the Client's input
string, and interpret each bit of the hash as a bit of the VIDPF index.

> CP: Are we comfortable recommending truncating the hash? Collisions aren't so
> bad since the Client can just lie about `alpha` anyway. The main thing is to
> pick a value for `BITS` that is large enough to avoid accidental collisions.

The Aggregators MAY aggregate a report any number times, but:

1. They MUST perform the range check (i.e., verify the FLP) the first time the
   reports are aggregated and remove any invalid reports before aggregating
   again.

2. The aggregation parameter MUST specify the last level of the VIDPF tree
   (i.e., `level` MUST be `Vidpf.BITS-1`).

> OPEN ISSUE Figure out if these requirements are strict enough. We may need to
> tighten aggregation parameter validity if we find out that aggregating at the
> same level more than once is not safe.

## Plain Heavy-Hitters with VIDPF-Proof Aggregation {#plain-heavy-hitters-with-proof-aggregation}
{:numbered="false"}

> TODO Account for "silently verifiable proofs" from {{RZCGP24}} into account
> here, which allows us to aggregate the FLPs as well.

The total communication cost of using Mastic (or Poplar1 {{!VDAF}}) for heavy
hitters is `O(num_measurements * Vidpf.BITS)` bits exchanged between the
Aggregators, where `num_measurements` is the number of reports being
aggregated. For plain heavy-hitters, this can be reduced to `O(Vidpf.BITS)` in
the best case.

The idea is to take advantage of the feature of VIDPF evaluation whereby the
Aggregators compute identical VIDPF proofs if and only if the report is valid.
This allows the proofs themselves to be aggregated: if each report in a batch of
reports is valid, then the hash of their proofs will be equal as well; on the
other hand, if one report is invalid, then the hash of the proofs will not be
equal.

To facilitate isolation of the invalid report(s), the proof strings are arranged
into a Merkle tree. During aggregation, the Aggregators interactively traverse
the tree to detect the subtree(s) containing invalid reports and remove them
from the batch.

> OPEN ISSUE Decide if we should spell this out in greater detail. This feature
> is not compatible with {{?DAP=I-D.draft-ietf-ppm-dap-07}}; if we wanted to
> extend DAP to support this, then we'd need to specify the wire format of the
> messages exchanged between the Aggregators.

In the worst case, isolating invalid reports requires `O(num_measurements *
Vidpf.BITS)` bits of communication and many `Vidpf.BITS` rounds of communication
between the Aggregators. However, this behavior would only be observed under
attack conditions in which the vast majority of Clients are malicious.

In the simple case where the `beta` value is a constant (e.g., 1) we can replace
the FLP check with a simpler check. FLPs are not compatible with proof
aggregation the way VIDPFs are. In order to perform the range check without
FLPs, we use an extension of VIDPF described by {{MST24}}. The high-level idea
here is that the Aggregators can evaluate the empty string and verify that they
have shares of the constant `beta`. Next, as described in {{vdaf}}, we use the
"one-hot verifiability" and "path verifiability" checks to verify that each
level is non-zero at only a single point and that the same constant `beta` is
propagated down the tree correctly. Note that this trick is not suitable for
weighted heavy-hitters, since it expects that each `beta` value is constant
(e.g., 1).

> OPEN ISSUE Proof aggregation could work with plain Mastic, but we would need

## Robustness Against a Malicious Aggregator {#malicious-security-with-three-aggregators}
{:numbered="false"}

Next, we describe an enhancement that allows Mastic to achieve robustness in the
presence of a malicious Aggregator. The two-party Mastic (as well as Poplar1) is
susceptible to additive attacks by a malicious Aggregator. In more detail, if
one of the Aggregators starts acting maliciously, they can arbitrarily add to
the aggregation result (simply by adding to their own aggregation shares)
without the honest Aggregator noticing.

We can solve this problem in Mastic by using a technique from {{MST24}} that
lifts the two-party semi-honest secure PLASMA to the three-party maliciously secure
setting. Rather than having two Aggregators as in the previous setting, this
flavor involves three Aggregators, where every pair of Aggregators communicate
over a different channel. In essence, each pair of Aggregators will run one
session of the VDAF with unique randomness but on the same Client measurement.
The following changes are necessary:

1. The Client needs to generate three pairs of VIDPF keys all corresponding to
   the same `alpha` and `beta` values. We represent the keys based on the
   session as follows:
   1. Session 0 (between Aggregators 0 and 1): `key_01, key_10`
   2. Session 1 (between Aggregators 1 and 2): `key_12, key_21`
   3. Session 2 (between Aggregators 2 and 0): `key_20, key_02`

   Each pair of Aggregators cannot check that the Client input is consistent
   across two sessions without the involvement of the third Aggregator. To
   address this, we let two Aggregators (i.e., Aggregators 0 and 1) to run all
   three sessions so that they can check that the Client input is consistent
   across three sessions. The third Aggregator (i.e., Aggregator 2) is involved
   as an attestator in two of the sessions. The check involves field addition
   and subtraction and then hash comparisons.

2. The Client sends the following keys to the Aggregators:
   1. Aggregator 0 receives: `key_01`, `key_02`, and `key_21`
   2. Aggregator 1 receives: `key_10`, `key_12`, and `key_20`
   3. Aggregator 2 receives: `key_21` and `key_20`

3. The Aggregators need to verify that the Client's input is consistent across
   the different sessions (i.e., that all the keys correspond to the same
   `alpha` and `beta` values). Aggregators 0 and 1 check that:
   1. Their output shares of Session 0 minus their output shares of Session 1
    are shares of zero
   2. Their output shares of Session 1 minus their output shares of Session 2
      are shares of zero.

   The subtraction is a local operation and verifying that two Aggregators possess
   a sharing of zero requires exchanging one hash.

Using a third Aggregator, we can lift the security of Mastic from the
semi-honest setting to malicious security. While more complex to implement than
2-party Mastic, this mode allows achieves both privacy and robustness against a
malicious Aggregator.
